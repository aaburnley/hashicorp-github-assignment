# hashicorp-github-assignment

This repository (repo) was created for a HashiCorp writing assignment. The assignment had the following requirments:
  - Create a repo on GitHub
  - Add content to the repo
  - Create a pull request to edit the content
  
 ## Learning objectives
 These are the learing objectives of this assignment:
 - Demonstrate my ability to use GitHub
 - Show that I understand and use markdown language
 - Show that I can use tools such as VS Code
 - Showcase my writing abilities
 - Demonstrate my thought process as I approach documentation tasks
 
 ## How I approached this assignment
 
 The first thing I did was read the instructions thoroughly to make sure that I understood what I needed to do to complete the assignment. Then I created the repo on my GitHub account by clicking the green **New** button next to *Top Repositories* on the top of the home page. After naming the repo, I selected it from my list and then created the README.md file for the repo.
 
 I compeleted the introduction, learning objectives, challenges, and about me section. Then I began to work on the assignment with plans to come back the *How I approached this assignment* section to write more about the process after completing the assignment.
 
 Next, I created the file and added it to the repo on the GitHub site. I named it *git-commands-comparison* since the instructions didn't include a preffered name. After that I decided to change the concept of the document to explain what commands to use when a user wants to get and merge changes using Git, while still including the information about the differences between the Git commands. I also including a introduction to explain what the article was going to teach the reader. 
 
 ## Challenges
 
 The main challenge I faced was making the time to do this assignment. When I connected with Fallon and recieved the assignment, it was right before I was going to go back to Seattle for my cousin's funeral. I was out for work 2 days and took Wednesday to get back home. Then I had to catch up on emails things pending while I was away. So I didn't start the project until after I finished work on Friday. 
 
 Another challenge was that GitHub wouldn't allow me to fork the repo because I am also the owner. Since I couldn't fork the repo, I couldn't clone my fork as a local copy to VS code and set the upstreams so that I could create a pull request. Instead I made a change on the doc on the GitHub website, and instead of commite that change directly to the main branch, I created a new branch to start the pull request.
 
  Normally, I would fork the main repo and then clone my fork. After cloning the fork into a folder on my local machine, I would connect the cloned repo to the main repo by using the command `git remote add upstream [main repo]`. Then verify that the upstream was set up correctly by performing the command `git remote -v`. After that, I would crate the branch I'd be working on to create my changes by using the command `git checkout -b [name-the-branch]`. This command creates the branch and puts you in that branch at the same time. I would select the file after making my branch, and then make my changes to the document in markdown. Now it's time to save the changes to my local repo with `git add --all` and then commit my saved changes using `git commit -m [what I changed]`. Now I can push my to changes from my local branch to the main repo using the command `git push origin [local-branch-name]`. After that, visual studio drops a link into the terminal that goes to GitHub where I can then create a pull request.
 
 ## Learnings
 
 Before doing this assignment, I wasn't aware that you couldn't fork a repo if you were the owner. In the future, it may be better to create the repo with one account and then do the assignment with another so that I can clone and fork the repo. Because of this, unfortuantely I had to use the site for all my edits and to create the pull request instead of doing from my local machine as suggested in the assignment. I did the assignment on my personal mac, so I should've taken the time to make sure everything would work on visual studio on mac and that my enviornment would be set up properly before starting.

Thanks for your consideration!
